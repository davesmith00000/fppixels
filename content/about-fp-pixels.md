> "Never build your own game engine. Almost never."

(I think that's probably the sum of all internet wisdom on the subject of building custom game engines.)

I have been compulsively programming games and graphics engines for years and years. I'm not claiming to be any good at it, I just find that I keep doing it. I'm a hobbyist, like someone that picks up their knitting every time they sit down in front of the TV, but it keeps me relatively sane.

My latest project is coding games and a game engine in Scala, and I thought it might be nice to scribble down a few notes as I go.
