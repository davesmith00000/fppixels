      <description>In my first devlog I mentioned the idea of adding sub-systems to Indigo so that I could nicely organise a job system for the game I&amp;rsquo;m working on.
The sub-systems came together quickly and easily, but the job system is still a work in progress. Since I haven&amp;rsquo;t written for a while though, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d explain what sub-systems are and how they work.
