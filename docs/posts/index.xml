			<description>This was a milestone week.
For the first time in more than a decade, this ex-Flash developer has actually finished making a game.
Admittedly the game is just a Snake clone, nothing fancy, but it is built on top of a custom engine I&amp;rsquo;m calling Indigo. Limited as Snake&amp;rsquo;s development needs were, getting from &amp;ldquo;it kinda works!&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s kinda finished!&amp;rdquo; has helped drive out a surprising number of engine requirements.</description>

<p>This was a milestone week.</p>

<p>For the first time in more than a decade, this ex-Flash developer has actually finished making a game.</p>

<p>Admittedly the game is just a Snake clone, nothing fancy, but it is built on top of a custom engine I&rsquo;m calling Indigo. Limited as Snake&rsquo;s development needs were, getting from &ldquo;it kinda works!&rdquo; to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s kinda finished!&rdquo; has helped drive out a surprising number of engine requirements.</p>

<p>While I have fond memories of my Flash developer days, in the intervening years I’ve been spoiled rotten by functional programming in Scala, and going back to mutable state is <em>hard</em>. As a consequence, Indigo is written in Scala, compiles to JavaScript, and presents a purely functional API.</p>

<p>I’m thoroughly enjoying it.</p>

<p>Having finished Snake I&rsquo;ve already started eyeing up the next project, and thought I might try and log its progress.</p>

<p>In the meantime, go and try out Snake for me! You can play Snake by following the link below, it has been tested in Firefox and Chrome, and yes you will need a keyboard.</p>

<p>The source code can be viewed on github &hellip;if you like that sort of thing.</p>
